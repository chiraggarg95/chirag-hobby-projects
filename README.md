## PDF Trimming Utility

`pdf_trim.py` is an interactive utility that extracts a range of pages from a PDF file and saves the result in a preset directory (`trimmed_pdfs` by default).

### Usage

Run the script and follow the prompts. Enter file paths without surrounding quotes:


```bash
python pdf_trim.py
```

You will be asked for the PDF path, the start and end page numbers, and optionally an output directory. The resulting PDF will be written to the chosen directory.
